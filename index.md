# Strobe-enhanced microscopy stage

The strobe-enhanced microscopy stage is a free and open-source workstation for imaging fast processes, particularly developed for microfluidic droplet generation. It uses the lens from the Raspberry Pi Camera to produce a microscope with a field of view of almost 1mm and an LED strobe illumination. Custom electronics allow the synchronization between the LED and the camera to capture sharp images of fast-moving droplets, cells or other microscopic objects. For maximum global accessibility the stage is low-cost, most parts can be self-made using a standard desktop 3d printer, and otherwise the stage contains standard parts that should be easily obtained in most areas of the world.

This design reuses and modified some elements the [OpenFlexure flat-top microscope](https://rwb27.gitlab.io/openflexure-flat-top-microscope/) open hardware design and its documentation.
