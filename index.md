# Strobe-Enhanced Microscope Station

The Strobe-Enhanced Microscope Station is a free and open-source workstation for bioimaging of fast processes. It supports using the lens from the Raspberry Pi Camera to produce a microscope with a field of view of about 950Î¼m and a strobe based on a high-power LED for imaging fast-moving objects.

This design is inspired by open-source hardware such as the [OpenFlexure flat-top microscope](https://rwb27.gitlab.io/openflexure-flat-top-microscope/).
